# design system concept

exploring ideas for an concept design system

- what do people need, and who are they?
- what content do we need?
- how do we build it?
- whats the best way to organise it?

## taking the best ideas from

- GOV.UK design system
- NHS Design manual
- things i need to do my job...
   - design + protoype realistic services
   - collaborate with collegaues in my service team, the wider organisation, communites of practice


## peoples needs

designers = service, interaction, content, graphic

as a designer working on tools for caseworkers I want to be able to make a prototype that enables us to maximise learning from caseworkers

as a designer working on tools for professionals using digital services I want to be able to make a prototype that enables us to maximise learning from them

as a front end developer building tools for caseworkers i want to build with proven, working code

as a tester, testing services, products and tools, I want to ensure whats built works as expected and meets the right standards

as a project team member (eg product, BA, etc) I want to be assured that common problems users have are being solved by proven solutions

as a new staff designer joining a team i want to be able to create designs as quickly and robustly as possible using my existing skills

to enable quality assurance and legal compliance (head of design, design seniors, product,  staff, laywers) I want to see what designs exist to solve common problems, such as quality, consistency, accessibilty, data protection - so I can be assured, and ask questions

as a user researcher working with the public, professional users and caseworkers, i want to be able to maximise usability testing and learning, and feedback insights that helps improve designs

at an assessment, healthcheck, or review - the team - want to be able to assure people that proven practice and designs are being followed



## repo background

this repo is a clone of HMLR GOV.UK Prototype Kit with form validation

which is a copy of the GOV.UK prototype kit, version 9.6.0, with form validation.

we are staring with this because - its a running node app that we are familiar with, and other staff designers should be familiar with.  So we can quickly test the ideas/what we need to do to make a coded proto, and discover if this would meet our needs, or if we should do something else.

THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION CODE - although it's good enough, I wouldn't build it like this for real.
