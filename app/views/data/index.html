    <p class="govuk-body-l">To create realistic prototypes and test code quickly and thoroughly:</p>

    <p><strong>Data</strong>: Anonymous, realistic data to use in prototypes and for testing whats being built: registers, digital applications</p>

    <p><strong>Analytics</strong>: examples to capture analytics from prototpyes and in production and display them in <a href="/patterns/dashboards/">service dashboards</a></p>

    <p><strong>Schemas</strong>: Schemas and example data to integrate with and test interfaces to existing infrastructural components</p>

    <p><strong>API's</strong>: Public, private and internal APIs - the schemas and example data to get information from, submit to - to test intefaces to existing infrastructural components</p>

    <p><strong>Third party interfaces</strong>: interface schemas and example data to get realistic sample data from, and sumbit to, third party test components and services.  like notifications, payments, licensed conveyancers, marriage register</p>

    <p><strong>Machine learning</strong>: Machine learning, AI, algorithms, sample data and models to test and explore what our machine learning tools can do</p>
