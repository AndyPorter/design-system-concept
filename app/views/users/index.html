    <p>Insights about the users and potential users of our services and Casework systems, in order design new services and improve existing ones</p>

    <p>Information that can be further tested, or used to improve existing services</p>

    <p>Insights gained from, and assumptions being tested with, qualitative research, and quantitative research</p>

    <p>These pages of the manual provide a high level overview of users of land registration services, their main aims, goals, tasks, problems, needs.  This is to help service teams and designers quickly get a good overview of their audiences. It enables better prototypes to be created more quickly - uncovering deeper and additional insights from user more quickly</p>
