    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get started</h2>
 		<p><a href="">Browse the manual with only the guidance for non gov.uk services</a> (hide all gov.uk and casework services content).  You may toggle this on and off on any page in this manual.</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h2>
    <p>This manual will contain examples to design, code and write for non gov.uk professional user and public services.  i.e. services available on the Internet, not hosted on a gov.uk domain.</p>

  	<p>The starting point for our services is gov.uk patterns, components and writing guides, as they are proven patterns, established by thousands to millions of individual users in prototyping and production services.</p>

    <p>GOV.UK patterns and components can be customised to make them work in the context of our services or our look and feel. Discuss adapting gov.uk patterns with the design community of practice - for help using them, and to help us develop them further. <a href="">find out how to discuss this with the design community</a></p>

    <p>You may also use non gov.uk patterns as a starting point to experiment if they would work for non gov.uk professional users.  Discuss their use with the design community of practice - for help using them, and to help us develop them further. <a href="">find out how to discuss this with the design community</a></p>
